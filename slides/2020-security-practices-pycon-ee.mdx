# Security Practices
for Building Django Applications

---

## Anton Alekseev

Tech Lead and Fullstack Developer at Thorgate

@aalekseev

<Notes>
Hello, I am a full-stack developer at Thorgate - a digital agency
focused on helping industry companies automate internal processes.

I am not a security professional, just a regular software developer
who decided to invest time in learning about security of web applications.

At Thorgate the vast majority of the project built on Django.
Django is a Python web-framework, wich means that you can build sites using Python!

Django is famous to be a secure framework, so does it means that we are done,
and sites built with Django secure? Let's find out!

## What is Security?

The big, the scary and the complicated

<Notes>
Security is a very big and scary topic. But at the same time it is very important to get know about it.

Every day we are reading about database leak, credit card info stolen, emails pawned.
No system is 100% secure and even big corporations struggle with it.
Sadly, this is a world that we are living in and as a developers we have a responsibility to protect
the user data of things that we are building.

## Misconceptions about security

1. It is a job for security professionals
1. Security is too complex to learn about
1. My framework will protect me from any security threats

<Notes>
1. It is a job for security professionals
    - Security is not just a thing for security experts. Security is a shared responsibility. It is everyone job.
        - It is responsibility of the staff members, sales, marketing team, to use strong passwords and keep them in password manager,
            and also be aware about phishing attacks
        - It is responsibility of the developer to look out for SQL injection, XSS attacks and more
        - It is responsibility of the engeneering manager to make sure that secure audits are done regularly
        - It is responsibility of the project manager to decline the changes from the client if it will be a security risk
1. Security is too complex to learn about
    - It is, especially cryptography. But at the same time, there are basic steps, if followed, that will make
        your web application better protected than vast majority of sites. Amature hackers looking for an easy target,
        and professional hacker will brake your site anyway if you don't have a dedicated InfoSec team.
1. Yes, from some of them. Your framework will protect you on the start, but as application logic grow,
    developers will itroduce more vulnerabilities in code and there will be less and less help from the framework itself.
</Notes>

## Security Parts

We won't be talking about:

1. Cryptography
1. Phishing and other social engeneering practices
1. Protecting the actual servers from being hacked

We will be talking:

1. Security mindset
1. How to make your website harder to hack into
1. How to protect your user's data from being stolen or altered

<Notes>
phishing - but do cheeck out the previous year Pycon talk about this

This slide/slides is about setting talk expectations.
Security is a broad topic, and I would like to set here some boundries.

## Common Security risks in web applications

[OWAPS Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project)

<Notes>
OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project. Nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.

Every year they publish 10 most common security vulnerabilities in Web Applications. Let's look into some of them
with the prism of Django framework.
</Notes>

---

## Injection

### What could go wrong?

```python
user_input = "Anton"
Customers.objects.raw(f'SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = {user_input}')
```

### Well, this -

```python
user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
Customers.objects.raw(f'SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = {user_input}')
```

<Notes>
This is a number 1 in OWASP top 10, most popular and most dangerous attack.
The threat is that user with malicious intent can provide a harmful input to the server,
and server will execute the code on the Database level.
Any user can read sensible data/modify the data in the database.

In this example we are looking into SQL injection, but it can be URL paramethers, request
headers, cookies, JSON, XML data inputs.
</Notes>

---

## Django vs SQL injection
1. Use Django ORM
    ```python
    user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
    Customers.objects.filter(customer_name=user_input)
    ```
1. If you can't - pass argumets instead of formatting the string
    ```python
    user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
    Customers.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = %s', user_input)
    ```

### Are we secure now?

<Notes>
Django ORM is your security blanket here, it will sanitize the user input for you.
However if you provided it with SQL query with user input already there, there is not much Django can do about it.

Using Django ORM might not be possible in some situations - for example
legacy code with huge 200 lines SQL statement that nobody understands anymore and it was not updated for 5 years.
In this case it is totally fine to pass user input as paramethers, that way it also will be sanitized and escaped
by Django and the database.

Are we secure now?
Well, in most cases - yes.
Django 2.1.11 - CVE-2019-14234: SQL injection possibility in key and index lookups for JSONField/HStoreField
</Notes>

---

## XSS

### What could go wrong?

```html
<div class="user-notes">
    {{ notes.content | safe }}
</div>
```

### Well, this -

```html
<div class="user-notes">
   <script>$('h1').text('Security Alert!');</script> 
</div>
```

<Notes>
XSS - is a cross-site scripting attack. It usually targets user browser.
Typical XSS attacks include session stealing, account takeower, key logging and
other types of client attacks.

One of the simple XSS examples is un-sanitized user input putted directly into template. 
</Notes>

---

## Django vs XSS attacks

1. From Django 1.0 - template system by default escapes html code, which mean no executable javascript
1. Fromt Django 2.1 you can use `json_script` to add JSON safely into template
1. If you can, use markdown instead of raw HTML to provide users with reach text editor
1. But other than that - check your templates for user input and if it was marked as safe

### Are we secure now?

<Notes>
? Needs further research
</Notes>

---

## Django vs Broken Authentication

Most of the things Django authentication framework will do for you (if you will use it).
But there is extra work to cover the basics:

- Serve your site over HTTPS
- `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` needs to be ON, to make stealing cookie with session ID harder
- Never expose a session ID outside protected cookies (especially in GET requests)
- Use password validation (build in Django from version 1.9) to preven usage of weak and well-known passwords
- If possible use 2FA

### Are we safe now?

<Notes>
**A candidate for removal**

Sometimes django applications use different types of authentication for client site and API layer.
You need to make sure that Token based authentication for API requests is following the basic
security practices as well and try not to use Basic Authentication
(authentication when you pass username in passowrd almost in plain text) for API if possible.
</Notes>

---

## Django vs Sensitive data exposure
Django nor any automated tool can protect you from making mistakes here.
However these basic things can help:

- Carefuly decide what data will be exposed in API
- Mask the data in the API if possible
- Don't store sensitive data "just in case"
- Make sure that if you are collecting sensitive data it is encrypted
- All sensitive data should be transmitted only via secure connection
- Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data

### Are we safe now?

<Notes>
Quite often web-applications will expose in the API endpoints real people/company
sensitive data such as health records, home addresses, phone numbers.

This is common in:
- DB
- Log files on the server
- Error Tracebacks

Nope. A regular security check to ensure that data exposed in API is protected is required.
</Notes>

---

## Django vs Broken Access Control

Django provides these helpers:
- For functional views `django.contrib.auth.decorators`:
    - `login_required`
    - `permission_required`
    - `user_passes_test` (generic function that receieves a user and returns boolean)
- For class-based views `django.contrib.auth.mixins`:
    - `LoginRequiredMixin`
    - `PermissionRequiredMixin`
    - `UserPassesTestMixin`
- You can also control which HTTP methods are permitted on a view
    - For functional views `django.views.decorators.http`:
        - `require_GET`, `require_POST`, `require_http_methods`, `require_safe`
    - For class-based views
        - `http_method_names` attribute

### Are we safe now?

<Notes>
Another common security pitfal is checking that user is authorized,
but never checking that user has permission to view/modify the data

Django provides listed helper functions, but properly applying them and
making a testing users permissions on a regular basis is a job of developers.
</Notes>

## Django vs Security misconfiguration

```
MONTH_DAY_FORMAT 	'F j'
NETLIFY_CRED 	'password123'
NETLIFY_USER 	'@aalekseev'
NUMBER_GROUPING 	0
PASSWORD_HASHERS 	'********************'
PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT 	'********************'
PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT_DAYS 	'********************'
PREPEND_WWW 	False
ROOT_URLCONF 	'vulnerable.urls'
SECRET_KEY 	'********************'
SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER 	False
```

### Are we safe now?

<Notes>
This is an example of improper configuration.

When you work with Django locally, to improve developer experience, on exception in the code
django will render a page with all the settings of the project and detailed traceback.

But what will be if we forgot to turn off development setting on deployed to production site?

The user is able to see a lot of information about the system. The good thing is that Django
applies a few rules to identify the sesible data like passwords to third party services in the settings
and mask them so they won't leak to debug page, application logs and error tracebacks.

However rules can't account for every usecase, and you can easily expose password to third party provider.
</Notes>

## Beyond OWASP top 10

The things that OWASP top 10 won't teach you about

1. Cache poisoning
1. DNS rebinding
1. Content sniffing
1. Cryptography, SSL
1. Malicious uses of Unicode and ASCII
1. Timing and other side-channel attacks
1. Many more

<Notes>
OWASP to 10 is a good starting point, and dealing with most common issues
is important, but there is a lot more to the vulnerabilities.
</Notes>

## Modern API vulnerabilities

- JWT manipulation
    - Validate using unique ID
    - Ensure JWT implementation does not support 'None' signature
    - JWT lifetime relatively short
    - check library flaw
- Insecure deserialization
    - integrate integrity check
    - isolate, then deserialize the data
    - monitor incoming and outgoing network ocnnectivity
    - instead of `yaml.load` use `yaml.safe_load`
- Insecure direct object reference
    - validate user using requested query
    - check database is that user genue or not
    - custom validation in server side as well as client side
    - JWT should be invalidated once user is loged out
- Server-side template injection

<Notes>
Ugh this is super important but currently missing!
</Notes>

## Tools

- [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- [Pycharm Python security plugin](https://pycharm-security.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Pipenv check](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#detection-of-security-vulnerabilities)

- [Django-security app](https://github.com/sdelements/django-security)
- [Django defender](https://github.com/jazzband/django-defender)
- [Django CSP](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp)

<Notes>
- Mozilla Observatory
    - Automatic tool that checks cookies, and request headers and a few other cheecks
- OWASP ZAP
    - This is an attack proxy. It sits between browser and application, intercepts requests, analyzes it for vulnerabilities and puts a report
        with links to OWASP documentation
- Pycharm python security plugin
    - The plugin looks at your Python code for common security vulnerabilities and suggests fixes. This is all-purpose plugin, not only for web-developers
    - It can automatically check with some extent for SQL injection, XSS and misconfiguration
- Pipenv check
    - If you are using Pipenv to lock project dependencies, it provides a command to check your dependencies graph and check for vulnerabilities in package versions
- Bandit
    - A tool that checks for security vulnerabilities and reports commited secrects, using raw SQL in Django but also lots of all-purpose security checks
- Django security app
    - Provides number of models, views, middlewares and forms to facilitate security hardening of Django applications.
- Django defender
    - A simple Django reusable app that blocks people from brute forcing login attempts.
- Django CSP
    - Add content security policy - aloowing to speciafy from where exactly your site is allowed to load any media, static and javascript files
</Notes>

## Minimal secure website checklist

1. HTTPS (for everything)
1. DEBUG is off by default (part of Django deploy checklist)
1. SECRET_KEY commited to the repository
1. Django check framework and particularly `manage.py check --deploy`
1. Change default admin url (this will not protect you from hackers, but it will make it harder)
1. Django version updated to the latest minor version
1. Don't ever trust user input and validate it all the time
    - Don't put user input directly into templates, SQL code or URL (ugh!!) 
1. Don't trust staff members to select secure passwords, add 2FA for admin site
1. Check not only that user can access the resource but also that they have rights to see/modify it
1. Do regular security checks with all the tools mentioned previously
1. serve static and media files from a cloud service or CDN (or you need to make complex steps to limit uploading size, to prevent DDoS, )

<Notes>
Easy to follow steps/checklist to start thinking about security (Key takeaways from the talk)
