<Notes>

Every day we are reading about database leak, credit card info stolen, emails pawned.
And this is a cases that you might know about, what about database leaks that never
got reported because the company is so small, or media did not catch up with the topic,
or security breach was not even noticed for years.

_Need to think do I want to make it so dark?_

And sometimes it is even about life and death.
On September 10, 2020 ransomware attack was launched on Dusseldorf Univercity.
And Univercity has a Hospital. Due to attack IT system of the Hospital was unusable,
and as a result one of the patients died.
https://hotforsecurity.bitdefender.com/blog/patient-dies-after-ransomware-attack-on-dusseldorf-hospital-24159.html

I feel that security is a topic that needs to be reminded every now and then,
that's why I am here today to talk about security.

**NEXT**: But before we dive into security practices in web applications,
let's talk a bit about what is security and myths round it.
</Notes>

## What is Security?

SECURITY DOES NOT EXIST

<img src={unicorn} style={{width: "50%", height: "auto"}} />

<p><small>
Image from <a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=2007266">Pixabay</a>
</small></p>

<Notes>

Right from the start let's be transparent about it - there is no such thing as security.
No system is 100% secure, and everything is mostly broken.

**NEXT**: With this out of the way, lets also make a quick look at other
misconseptions arount security itself, apart from that it does not exist.
</Notes>

---

## Misconceptions about security

1. It is a job for _**only**_ security professionals
    - Staff, Sales, Marketing - use strong passwords, know about phishing
    - Developers - know about vulnerabilities and follow security practices
    - Engeneering Managers - schedule secure audits
    - Project Managers - work with client to avoid changes that will introduce security risks
1. Security is too complex to learn about
1. My framework will protect me from all security threats

<Notes>

### It is a job for security professionals

Security is not just a thing for security experts.
Security is a shared responsibility. It is everyone job.

- It is responsibility of the staff members, sales, marketing team, to use strong passwords and keep them in password manager, and also be aware about phishing attacks
- It is responsibility of the developer to look out for SQL injection, XSS attacks and more
- It is responsibility of the engeneering manager to make sure that secure audits are done regularly
- It is responsibility of the project manager to decline the changes from the client if it will be a security risk

TRANSITION ???

### Security is too complex to learn about

It is, especially cryptography.
But at the same time, there are basic steps, if followed, that will make
your web application better protected than vast majority of sites. Amature hackers looking
for an easy target, and professional hacker will brake your site anyway
if you don't have a dedicated InfoSec team.

TRANSITION ???

### My framework will protect me from any security threats

Yes, from some of them. Your framework will protect you on the start, but as application logic grow,
developers will itroduce more vulnerabilities in code and there will be less and less
help from the framework itself.

**NEXT**: I hope that this explanation set you for a security mindset and
you are ready now to look into some juicy details.
</Notes>

## 10 Steps

1. Use secure connection for everything
2. Configure software with security in mind
3. Don't commit secrets to the repository
4. Pay attention to the versions of application dependencies
5. Make it harder for hackers to guess about your application
6. Research and use the tools that already available
7. Use automatic tools to check your application
8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it
9. Protect user data by requesting only what necessary 
10. Reject everything by default, allow only when have to

<Notes>

We see here a 10 steps checklist that we will be revisiting in the end as well.
All items in this checklist are sorted from easy things to fix to a more complex
topics where automation tools won't help you that much and you will be feeling
scared and alone.

**NEXT**: Let's get started!
</Notes>

---

## 1. Use secure connection (for everything)

<img src={mitm} style={{width: "50%", height: "auto"}} />

<Notes>

Why is it a first and most important step? Because HTTP connection is insecure,
it transfers information in plain text, does not use encription and can be easily intercepted
and modified on the fly.

Today to setup TLS sertificate is easy and free via Let's Encrypt initiative, and some hosting
platforms will offer you certificate automatically. But what is overlooked, is even if the site
itself is server over HTTPS connection, if parts of it still using insecure HTTP connection to load
images, javascript files or stylesheets is NOT using secure connection.

The resource that is requested via insecure connection still can be modified and replaced by
malicious user listening to the traffic in the free public WiFi.
This is called a man in the middle attack, and you can see it in the picture.

- https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/mixed-content-blocking-firefox

**NEXT**: Imagine that we have already a valid SSL certificate, and see what else
we need to check to ensure that our application truly using secure connection.
</Notes>

---

## 1. Use secure connection for everything (fix)

1. Ensure that SSL sertificates are not expired
1. Ensure that on load-balancer or proxy server all requests are redirected to secure connection.
    Also check out `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` Django setting
1. Ensure that every image, javascript and stylesheet are server under secure connection as well
1. Ensure that if your application communicate with third-party API it uses a secure connection
1. If your application needs to transfer files via FTP, prefer using SFTP

<Notes>

**NEXT**: With having secure connection to our web application, let's look at other things
that we need to configure in our application so it would be more secure.
</Notes>

---

## 2. Configure software with security in mind

- [№6 in OWASP Top 10 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A6-Security_Misconfiguration)
- [№10 in OWASP Top 10 - Insufficien Logging and Monitoring](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A10-Insufficient_Logging%252526Monitoring)

<img src={djangoErrorPage} style={{width: "100%", height: "auto"}} />

<Notes>
First you can see two links to the OWASP top 10. What is it?

https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/

OWASP - short for Open Web Application Security Project.
OWASP is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software.

Every year they publish 10 most common security vulnerabilities in Web Applications. And in this year
2020 we have 2 vulnerabilities that, at least in my mind, connected to each other.
One is misconfiguration and another is insufficient monitoring which basically means that
your system was not configured to alert you about suspicious activities - in other words you won't know
when you were hacked.

So, talking about misconfiguration - on the screenshot you see a Django debug page, it
intended for local development and show lots of information:
- Python version
- Django version
- Path on the server to the application
- Sensitive information from the exception itself like user ID and order ID
- All of the application settings
- Context information with variable values for the part of the code where exception happaned

This is intended for the local environment, and very helpful for developer. But let's Imagine
that this configuration was deployed. Lots of information to break into your application.

**NEXT**: So, how we will deal with that?

</Notes>

---

## 2. Configure software with security in mind (fix)

```console
$ python manage.py check --deploy
System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (security.W004) You have not set a value for the SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS setting. If your entire site is served only over SSL, you may want to consider setting a value and enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security. Be sure to read the documentation first; enabling HSTS carelessly can cause serious, irreversible problems.
?: (security.W008) Your SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT setting is not set to True. Unless your site should be available over both SSL and non-SSL connections, you may want to either set this setting True or configure a load balancer or reverse-proxy server to redirect all connections to HTTPS.
?: (security.W012) SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is not set to True. Using a secure-only session cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to hijack user sessions.
?: (security.W016) You have 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware' in your MIDDLEWARE, but you have not set CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE to True. Using a secure-only CSRF cookie makes it more difficult for network traffic sniffers to steal the CSRF token.
?: (security.W018) You should not have DEBUG set to True in deployment.
?: (security.W020) ALLOWED_HOSTS must not be empty in deployment.

System check identified 6 issues (0 silenced).
```

<Notes>

One simplest thing that we can do, and what (for example) Django is providing to
us - is a deploy system check.

We can see on this slide the output of this check.
With the command `python manage.py check --deploy` Django will run a set of
security checks and report you with things that you need to pay attention to.

But configuring software and servers is a much broader topic, which cannot fit
into this presentation. The only advice here is to read carefult sonftware confguration
manuals and regularly checking that indeed conftware is configured properly.

**NEXT**: Django security check is pretty good starting point, but it is not perfect,
and defiantely there is more to check before deploynig your application. One of the
easy to miss things is commiting the secret codes, password or other sensitive information
to the version control.
</Notes>

---

## 3. Don't commit secrets to the repository

#### 2 600 000 results on GitHub containing "SECRET_KEY" word

<img src={commitingSecrets} style={{height: "auto"}} />

<Notes>

What will happen if we commit and push our code with SECRET_KEY
or any other sensitive data like password to the email service,
in plain text to the remote repository in GitHub, GitLab or Bitbacket?

Once something enters the internet, it is really hard to remove
it. It is a bit scary, I searched in github
word "secret key" and it shows 2.5M results for only python code
and for only "SECRET_KEY" keyword.

In this case we are looking at commited secret keys to Django
application. With this string of characters Django encrypt
and decrypt for example user passwords. With this information
hackers can create false user sessions and easily decrypt hash of the user password
that django keeps in the database to a plain text.

**NEXT**: So how do we fix that?
</Notes>

---

## 3. Don't commit secrets to the repository (fix)

1. Create a new secret key
1. Use environment variables to store it
    - For Django we use [Django-environ](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
1. Remove the old secret key from Git history (if possible)
    - Requires to mess around with Git reflog and might be dangerous
1. Redeploy the application

<Notes>

The good news is that external automatic tools, that we will be looking into
a bit later, can detect this and will notify us, _if we will use the tools_.

Imagine that we check our project and found out that secret key to access 
your email provider was commited to the repository. How can we fix that?

1. Lets create a new secret key, password, anything
2. Then we update the project code to get secret key from the environment variable. For example
    with Django we are using django-environ package, that makes dealing with environment
    variables and sanitizing the input easy.
3. If possible, remove secret key from the Git history
4. Finally - redeply the application

**NEXT**: ???.
</Notes>

---

## 4. Pay attention to the versions of application dependencies

- [№9 in OWASP Top 10 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities)

### [CVE-2019-6975: Memory exhaustion in django.utils.numberformat.format()](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/feb/11/security-releases/)

Django versions before 2.1.5, 2.0.10 and 1.11.18

If `django.utils.numberformat.format()` -- used by `contrib.admin` as well as the the `floatformat`,
`filesizeformat`, and `intcomma` templates filters -- received a **Decimal** with a large number 
of digits or a large exponent, it could lead to significant memory usage due to a call to
`'{:f}'.format()`.

<Notes>

MISSING good examples :(

Hopefully we all know, that libraries constantly release new versions that deal not
only with features and bugfixes but also fixing security vulnerabilities. And it is a 
responsibility of the developer to frequently check and update library versions and setup
notifications about new versions.

As an example there is a vulnerability for listed Django versions about template tags
that display numbers. This vulnerability can be used to create a denial of service
attack. The goal of denial of service attack is to make web-resource temporary or
indefinately unavailable. With this vulnerability attacker needs to have a page that
displays numbers with one of the listed template filters and a long decimal number.
Due to the vulnerability, the page will consume big amount of server memory and by requesting
the page from different machines multiple times, the application might went down.

**NEXT**: Luckily there are automatic tools that make having notifications
about new secure versions easy to receieve.
</Notes>

---

## 4. Pay attention to the versions of application dependencies (fix)

```
(venv) ➜  django_sec safety check --full-report
+==============================================================================+
| REPORT                                                                       |

+==============================================================================+
```

<Notes>

Here we can see an example of the full report of `safety` package, it can not only
show insecure versions but also short explanation. See that here we as well have
memory consumption vulnerability as described in previous slides.

This check can be setup to run each time you push changes to the repository, or better
to run it periodically and send for example emails when new more secure version of the
library is available.

**NEXT**: As a next step, let's see how we can make it harder for attacker to
gather information about our application 
</Notes>

---

## 5. Make it harder for attackers to guess about your application

[Insecure Direct Object Reference](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/05-Authorization_Testing/04-Testing_for_Insecure_Direct_Object_References)

What can user try to do with this URL?

- `https://mysite.com/api/v1/users/1/order/2167/`

Is it hard to guess the admin login url here?

- `https://mysite.com/admin/`

<Notes>

Officially named "Insecure Direct Object Reference", it is mostly related to the leaking
IDs of the objects. Simple example is API request with user ID, we can try to check if we
have access to the next user, or previous user in the database but replacing the ID number.

But I also added here what I think is related to guessing, like

- How hard it is to guess admin login page to make a brute-force attack
    trying well-known vulnerable passwords?
- How hard it is to guess the Django version of the application, to try to perform
    a vulnerability that was not patched in that version?

**NEXT**: Let's look on the next slide how we can improve situation a little bit,
but keep in mind, this is not to stop the attack but rather to make it slower.
</Notes>

---

## 5. Make it harder for hackers to guess about your application (fix)

1. Change the default admin dashboard url
1. Use other references for objects than ID from the database
1. Check that you are not leaking in plain text information about your system
    in error messages, logs, emails

<Notes>

Changing the admin URL can really make a long way and difference. Most automatic
tools that scans for admin urls on sites have a predefined dictionary of keywords that they use,
and if you are a harder target, the attacker might just skip you application.

**NEXT**: ??? No connection to the next slide :(
</Notes>

---

## 6. Research and use the tools that already available

1. Run django deploy check `python manage.py check --deploy`
1. Manage user access with `user_passes_test` and `permission_requred`
1. Manage allowed methods with `require_safe`, `require_POST`
1. When you need to compare two strings securely use [`constant_time_compare`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/crypto.py#L77)
1. When you need to securely sign some data and verify it later, use [`signing`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/signing/) module
1. To prevent sensitive data being leaked into application logs, use [`sensitive_variables`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/d8e233352877c37c469687287e7761e05bdae94e/django/views/decorators/debug.py#L6) decorator
1. To protect POST paramethers being leaked into application logs, use [`sensitive_post_paramethers`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/d8e233352877c37c469687287e7761e05bdae94e/django/views/decorators/debug.py#L47) decorator
1. If you need to render JSON to template use `json_script`

<Notes>

For example Django comes with a lot of tools out of the box, you
as a developer just need to be avare of them and use accordingly.

Here are some examples that I found mentioned on the internet.

**NEXT**: Now when we looked into built-in tools, lets see what extra tools can we use
to make our application more secure.
</Notes>

---

## 7. Use automatic tools to check your application

- [Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
- [Pycharm Python security plugin](https://pycharm-security.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Pipenv check](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#detection-of-security-vulnerabilities)
- [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- [Django-security app](https://github.com/sdelements/django-security)
- [Django defender](https://github.com/jazzband/django-defender)
- [Django CSP](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp)
- [Django XSS fuzzer](https://github.com/tonybaloney/django-xss-fuzzer)

<Notes>

There is a lot of cool automatic tools that can help you to identify some of
the vulnerabilities. It would be a shame not to use them.

1. **Mozilla Observatory**
    - Automatic tool that checks cookies, and request headers and a few other cheecks
1. **OWASP ZAP**
    - This is an attack proxy. It sits between browser and application, intercepts requests, analyzes it for vulnerabilities and puts a report
        with links to OWASP documentation
1. **Pycharm python security plugin**
    - The plugin looks at your Python code for common security vulnerabilities and suggests fixes. This is all-purpose plugin, not only for web-developers
    - It can automatically check with some extent for SQL injection, XSS and misconfiguration
1. **Pipenv check**
    - If you are using Pipenv to lock project dependencies, it provides a command to check your dependencies graph and check for vulnerabilities in package versions
1. **Bandit**
    - A tool that checks for security vulnerabilities and reports commited secrects, using raw SQL in Django but also lots of all-purpose security checks
1. **Django-security app**
    - Provides number of models, views, middlewares and forms to facilitate security hardening of Django applications.
1. **Django defender**
    - A simple Django reusable app that blocks people from brute forcing login attempts.
1. **Django CSP**
    - Add content security policy - aloowing to speciafy from where exactly your site is allowed to load any media, static and javascript files

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it

- [№1 in OWASP Top 10 - Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection)
- [№4 in OWASP Top 10 - XML External Entities (XXE)](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A4-XML_External_Entities_(XXE))
- [№7 in OWASP Top 10 - Cross-Site Scripting XSS](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS))
- [№8 in OWASP Top 10 - Insecure Deserialization](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A8-Insecure_Deserialization)

Not all users are nice.

<Notes>
User input can take many forms
- A comment form under the blog post
- A user profile image that user uploads themself
- An XML file that user to upload some data

But what is common theme - is that not all users are nice, and will do what they "suppose"
to do with your application.

**NEXT**: Lets look on 2 most common attacks - on the client side and on the server side.
</Notes>

---

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (XSS)

<img src={xssTweetdeck} style={{width: "100%", height: "auto"}} />

1. From Django 1.0 - template system by default escapes html code
1. Fromt Django 2.1 you can use `json_script` to add JSON safely into template
1. If you can, use markdown instead of raw HTML to provide users with reach text editor
1. But other than that - check your templates for user input and if it was marked as safe

<Notes>

So the story goes that there was a popular at that time application Tweetdeck, that many people
and celebrities used to manage multiple twitter accounts. And one day one smart person tried to
post a tweet with javascript code inside. And it worked. After that all people who was subscribed
to this person got alert in Tweetdeck - hey there is a XSS vulnerability in Tweetdeck. Luckily
it was not a malicious user and cosiquences would be far more dangerous.

In the essence cross site scripting related to unsanitized user input on the client side of the
application. Most of the time this attack is most powerful when the code that one user submitted
application rendered is visible to other users.
Typical XSS attacks include session stealing, account takeower, key logging.

Here are some of the things that you can do, to prevent the XSS attack in Django application.

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (SQLi)

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png" style={{width: "100%", height: "auto"}} />

```python
user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
Customers.objects.raw(f'SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = {user_input}')
```

First attack [Feb 2002](https://www.securityfocus.com/news/346) (18 years ago), and a recent one -
[August 2020](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/freepik-data-breach-hackers-stole-83m-records-via-sql-injection/
), Freepick SQL injection 83 000 000 user records stolen

<Notes>

SQL injection. This is a number 1 in OWASP top 10, most popular and most dangerous attack.
The threat is that user with malicious intent can provide a harmful input to the server,
and server will execute the code on the Database level.
Any user can read/change sensible data in the database. And even though this attack is known for
almost **20** years

And a classical XKCD comics about it

In this example we are looking into SQL injection, but it can be URL paramethers, request
headers, cookies, JSON, XML data inputs.

**NEXT**: Ok, this is a scare and old attack vector, what can we do about it?

## 8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it (SQLi)

1. Use Django ORM
    ```python
    user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
    Customers.objects.filter(customer_name=user_input)
    ```
1. If you can't - pass argumets instead of formatting the string
    ```python
    user_input = '"" or 1 = 1;--'
    Customers.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = %s', [user_input])
    ```
    This way the parameters for SQL query will be escaped by the underlying database driver.
    And the execute query will be similar to
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE customer_name = '"" or 1 = 1;--';
    ```
    Note the single columns `'`, expression inside them won't be evaluated

<Notes>

Django ORM is your security blanket here, it will sanitize the user input for you.
However if you provided it with SQL query with user input already there,
there is not much Django can do about it.

Using Django ORM might not be possible in some situations - for example
legacy code with huge 200 lines SQL statement that nobody understands anymore
and it was not updated for 5 years.
In this case it is totally fine to pass user input as paramethers,
that way it also will be sanitized and escaped by Django and the database.

## 9. Protect user data by requesting only what necessary 

- [№3 in OWASP Top 10 - Sensitive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A3-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)

Django nor any automated tool can protect you from making mistakes here.
However these basic things can help:

- Carefuly decide what data will be exposed in API
- Mask the data in the API if possible
- Don't store sensitive data "just in case"
- Make sure that if you are collecting sensitive data it is encrypted
- All sensitive data should be transmitted only via secure connection
- Disable caching for responses that contain sensitive data

<Notes>

Quite often web-applications will expose in the API endpoints real people/company
sensitive data such as health records, home addresses, phone numbers.

This is common in:
- DB
- Log files on the server
- Error Tracebacks

## 10. Reject everything by default, allow only when have to

- [№5 in OWASP Top 10 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control)

```python
def transfer_money_view(request):
    if not request.user.is_authenticated:
        raise PermissionDenied

    form = TransferMoneyForm(request.GET or request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        form.save()

    return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse("home"))
```

<Notes>

Another common security pitfal is checking that user is authorized,
but never checking that user has permission to view or change the data.

Properly applying access permissions and making testing user permissions a regular activity
is a job of developer.

## Recap on 10 Steps

1. Use secure connection for everything
2. Configure software with security in mind
3. Don't commit secrets to the repository
4. Pay attention to the versions of application dependencies
5. Make it harder for hackers to guess about your application
6. Research and use the tools that already available
7. Use automatic tools to check your application
8. Don't trust user input and sanitize it
9. Protect user data by requesting only what necessary 
10. Reject everything by default, allow only when have to

<Notes>

**NEXT**: So we looked at all this nice steps, but we missed one very important step.
</Notes>

## STEP 0

Make security checks a reccuring activity

<Notes>

NEEDS IMAGE?

As simple as that. I can't add anything else here, without this step
every other step just won't work.

**NEXT**: I have a few more slides with additional resources
if you want to learn more about security.

## What next?

The things that OWASP top 10 won't teach you about

1. Cache poisoning
1. DNS rebinding
1. Content sniffing
1. Cryptography, SSL
1. JWT manipulation
1. Server-side template injection
1. Malicious uses of Unicode and ASCII
1. Timing and other side-channel attacks
1. Many more

<Notes>

OWASP to 10 is a good starting point, and dealing with most common issues
is important, but there is a lot more to the vulnerabilities.
